  // The game above is completely parameterized by the JSON file you see
  // before you. This is by design -- the intent for this mahjong client
  // is to be a universal mahjong engine. The engine has no notion
  // of 'tanyao' or 'tenpai' -- those are mere words in a JSON file that
  // the engine blindly interprets. Yaku is customizable, calls are
  // customizable, even the auto buttons on the bottom are customizable.
  // The major design goal is to be able to play any variant of mahjong out
  // there -- Hong Kong, American, Saki-power-infused mahjong.

If you have three of a tile and someone discards the fourth, you may create an open kan (daiminkan). If you have called a triplet and draw the fourth tile, you may create an added kan (kakan). Kan calls count as triplets for the purposes of winning and scoring, but they award 4x triplet fu. In all three cases, after declaring kan you draw a replacement tile from the dead wall. Winning on this replacement tile awards the rinshan yaku (1 han). One may also call ron on a tile added to an added kan (kakan) for the chankan yaku (1 han). Having three kans is 2 han (sankantsu), and having four is yakuman. There can be at most four kans in a single game."},
