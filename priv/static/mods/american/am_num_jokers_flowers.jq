# this mod allows players to set the number of jokers and flowers in the set. useful for beginners who want extra jokers, or for players who wish to play a historical variation. support for flowers acting as jokers (as in pre-1970s rules) and jokers acting as more-powerful flowers (as in 1960s rules) will come some other day.

# oops, looks like i have no clue how to add a tile n times to the wall in majs, so i'm using jq instead:

# define function for adding n copies of a tile to the wall
def add_n_tiles($tile; $num):
  if $num > 0 then
      . += [$tile]
      |
      add_n_tiles($tile; $num - 1)
  else . end;

# add $jokers number of jokers to the wall
.wall |= add_n_tiles("1j"; $jokers)
|
if $flowers == 8 then
  .wall += ["1f", "2f", "3f", "4f", "1g", "2g", "3g", "4g"]
else
  .wall |= add_n_tiles("1f"; $flowers)
end
