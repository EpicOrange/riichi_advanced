## Supported rulesets

- [__Riichi__](documentation/riichi.md): The classic riichi ruleset, now with an assortment of mods to pick and choose at your liking.
- [__Sanma__](documentation/sanma.md): Three-player Riichi.
- __Space Mahjong__: Riichi, but sequences can wrap (891, 912), and you can make sequences from winds and dragons. In addition, you can chii from any direction, and form open kokushi (3 han).
- __Cosmic Riichi__: A Space Mahjong variant with mixed triplets, more yaku, and more calls.
- [__Galaxy Mahjong__](documentation/galaxy.md): Riichi, but one of each tile is replaced with a blue galaxy tile that acts as a wildcard of its number. Galaxy winds are wind wildcards, and galaxy dragons are dragon wildcards.
- [__Kansai Sanma__](documentation/kansai.md): Sanma, but you draw until the last visible dora indicator. In addition, all fives are akadora, fu is fixed at 30, there is no tsumo loss, and scores are rounded to the nearest 1000. Flowers act as nukidora in place of north winds, which are now yakuhai. Exhaustive draws in south round always result in a repeat regardless of who's tenpai.
- [__Chinitsu__](documentation/chinitsu_challenge.md): Two-player variant where the only tiles are bamboo tiles. Try not to chombo!
- __Minefield__: Two-player variant where you start with 34 tiles to make a mangan+ hand, and your remaining tiles are your discards.
- __Sakicards v1.3__: Riichi, but everyone gets a different Saki power, which changes the game quite a bit. Some give you bonus han every time you use your power. Some let you recover dead discards. Some let you swap tiles around the entire board, including the dora indicator.
- [__Hong Kong__](documentation/hk.md): Hong Kong Old Style mahjong. Three point minimum, everyone pays for a win, and win instantly if you have seven flowers.
- [__Sichuan Bloody__](documentation/sichuan.md): Sichuan Bloody mahjong. Trade tiles, void a suit, and play until three players win (bloody end rules).
- [__MCR__](documentation/mcr.md): Mahjong Competition Rules. Has a scoring system of a different kind of complexity than Riichi.
- __Taiwanese__: 16-tile mahjong with riichi mechanics.
- [__Bloody 30-Faan Jokers__](documentation/bloody30faan.md): Bloody end rules mahjong, with Vietnamese jokers, and somehow more yaku than MCR.
- [__American (NMJL)__](documentation/american.md): American Mah-Jongg. Assemble hands with jokers, and declare other players' hands dead.
- [__Vietnamese__](documentation/vietnamese.md): Mahjong with eight differently powerful joker tiles.
- __Malaysian__: Three-player mahjong with 16 flowers, a unique joker tile, and instant payouts.
- __Singaporean__: Mahjong with various instant payouts and various unique ways to get penalized by pao.
- __Custom__: Create and play your own custom ruleset.

Each ruleset has optional mods like chombo and aotenjo, you'll have to check out each one to discover its variants!

## Custom rulesets

Once you enter the lobby or room for a ruleset you can scroll down to view the JSON object defining the ruleset.

If you're looking to make a custom ruleset using the game's MahjongScript ruleset language, that documentation is available [here](documentation/documentation.md). To play a custom ruleset, simply select Custom on the main page, click Room Settings, and paste and edit your ruleset in the box provided.

Otherwise, click Room Settings and the Config tab to reveal an [MahjongScript](documentation/mahjongscript.md) editor, where any MahjongScript you write will be applied to the game.

## How can I contribute?

Mostly we need people to play and [report bugs](https://github.com/EpicOrange/riichi_advanced/issues), of which there are likely many. We also accept pull requests so if you see an [issue](https://github.com/EpicOrange/riichi_advanced/issues) you'd like to tackle, feel free to do so!

Also if you know of any English-based mahjong rulesets available online, do tell us in Discord and we'll add it to the list!

Monetary contributions are not accepted at this time.

## Running the server locally

First, install Elixir (≥ 1.14), `npm`, `z3`, and `jq`.

Then run:

    git clone "https://github.com/EpicOrange/riichi_advanced.git"
    cd riichi_advanced

    # Get Elixir dependencies
    mix deps.get

    # Generate self-signed certs for local https
    mix phx.gen.cert

    # Get Node dependencies (there aren't many)
    (cd assets; npm i)

    # Start the server
    HTTPS_PORT=4000 iex -S mix phx.server

This should start the server up at `https://localhost:4000`. (Make sure to use `https`! `http` doesn't work locally for some reason.) Phoenix should live-reload all your changes to Elixir/JS/CSS files while the server is running.

If it complains about a daemon not running, open a separate terminal and run `epmd` (Erlang Port Mapper Daemon), and try again.
