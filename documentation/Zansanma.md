# ZAN LEAGUE RULES
Zan League (also known as ThANM, or Three Agent Neoteric Mahjong), founded in 2022, is an attempt to consolodate popular Kansai Sanma rules into a ruleset that is exciting and fun to play, as well as makes for a strong televised broadcast.

Zan's major difference from other sanma rules is the complete distillation of points into shuugi (hereafter referred to as chips) at the end of play. Instead of getting a plus/minus score at the end of the game, your final score and overall placing will determine the amount of chips you will win or lose. 

At the end of a hanchan, players pay chips according to the chart below. If 2nd place is above 50,000 points at the end of the hanchan, they will collect a small amount of the pot. 1st will earn the remainder of the pot.


| End of Game Points |2nd Place Payout| 3rd Place Payout|
|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
|90,000 Points| +8 |
|80,000 Points| +6 |
|70,000 Points| +4 |
|60,000 Points| +2 | 
|50,000 Points|Â±0 | -6
|40,000 Points| -2 | -8
|30,000 Points| -4 | -10
