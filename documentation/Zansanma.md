# ZAN RULES
Zan League (also known as ThANM, or Three Agent Neoteric Mahjong), founded in 2022, is an attempt to consolodate popular Kansai Sanma rules into a ruleset that is exciting and fun to play, as well as makes for a strong televised broadcast.

## Winning Chips is the Objective of ZAN

**Zan's major difference from other sanma rules is the complete distillation of points into shuugi (hereafter referred to as chips) at the end of play.** Instead of getting a plus/minus score at the end of the game, your final point score and overall placing will determine the amount of chips you will win or lose. 

At the end of a hanchan, players pay chips according to the chart below. If 2nd place is above 50,000 points at the end of the hanchan, they will collect a small amount of the pot. 1st place will win the remainder of the pot.


| End of Game Points |2nd Place Payout| 3rd Place Payout|
|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
|90,000 Points| +8 |
|80,000 Points| +6 |
|70,000 Points| +4 |
|60,000 Points| +2 | 
|50,000 Points|Â±0 | -6
|40,000 Points| -2 | -8
|30,000 Points| -4 | -10
|20,000 Points| -6 | -12
|10,000 Points| -8 | -14
|Thousands of points|-10| -16
|0| -12 | -18

## Winning Chips Midmatch

Chips are also exchanged during a match:  
* 1 Ron/ 2 Tsumo for Ippatsu, Ura Dora, and drawing the Shiropocci Tile after a Riichi.  
* 2 bonus chips for busting an opponent (split in case of Double Ron)  
* Yakuman (NON KAZOE) grant 10 ron and 5 tsumo
* Drawing all 4 Flower Tiles and winning the hand gives bonus of 10 ron and 5 tsumo (as well as 4 Dora!!)

## Tiles Used

### Sanma Tileset
Zan Sanma is played with the same tiles as normal Riichi Mahjong, with the 2-8 man being removed.

### Every 5 is RED!
Every 5 pin and 5 sou is worth 1 dora.  

### Flower Tiles  
4 Flower tiles are added to the standard 108. When they are drawn, you immediately set them to the side and draw a rinshan tile. Each Flower tile is worth 1 Dora. If a Flower tile is the Dora Indicator, each Flower tile is worth 2 Dora. You win bonus Chips if you set aside all 4 Flowers in a hand.



  
### Shiropocchi
1 Haku tile is replaced with a Shiropocchi, which functions as a Haku normally. However, **if you draw it after you've declared Riichi, you can treat it like any tile you need, even if all the copies of that tile are dead.** You even win bonus chips!

## Basic Rules

### Open Riichi
**A special kind of Riichi**. If you're in Furiten, it's the only way to declare Riichi. You pay 1000 points, and open your hand for the other players. If you Tsumo, or Ron off another player who has declared Riichi themselves, it is 2 Han. 

**If a player not in Riichi openly deals into an Open Riichi, it is a Yakuman, with the 10 chip bonus.**

* Starting Points: 50,000 
* Kuitan OK, Atozuke OK, Pinfu Tsumo OK
* Draw through the deadwall, to the Dora indicator.
* North (Pei) is Yakuhai (not Nukidora)
* No abortive hands (A 5th Kan cannot be made)
* Missed Win (If you are in riichi and you do not win off the first valid discard, you cannot win with Ron for the rest of the hand)
* Kan after Riichi is optional (as long as it doesn't change your wait)
* Furiten Riichi is only allowed if you Open Riichi
* You can choose to Riichi even if you do not have another tile to draw
* Noten payment is 2000 Points.
* Renchan payment is 1000 x honba per Ron, 1000 x honba ALL per Tsumo
* Busting Out is at 0 Points, not negative.
* Double Ron OK (Riichi payments, Honba payments etc. goes to whoever the next Dealer will be)
* Concealed Kans are NOT SAFE from Kokushi Musou Tenpai
* Double Yakuman OK, No Pao 
* In case of a tie for First, the next Dealer wins
