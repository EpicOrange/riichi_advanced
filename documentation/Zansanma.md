# ZAN RULES
Zan League (also known as ThANM, or Three Agent Neoteric Mahjong), founded in 2022, is an attempt to consolodate popular Kansai Sanma rules into a ruleset that is exciting and fun to play, as well as makes for a strong televised broadcast.

## Winning Chips is the Objective of ZAN

**Zan's major difference from other sanma rules is the complete distillation of points into shuugi (hereafter referred to as chips) at the end of play.** Instead of getting a plus/minus score at the end of the game, your final point score and overall placing will determine the amount of chips you will win or lose. 

At the end of a hanchan, players pay chips according to the chart below. If 2nd place is above 50,000 points at the end of the hanchan, they will collect a small amount of the pot. 1st place will win the remainder of the pot.


| End of Game Points |2nd Place Payout| 3rd Place Payout|
|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
|90,000 Points| +8 |
|80,000 Points| +6 |
|70,000 Points| +4 |
|60,000 Points| +2 | 
|50,000 Points|Â±0 | -6
|40,000 Points| -2 | -8
|30,000 Points| -4 | -10
|20,000 Points| -6 | -12
|10,000 Points| -8 | -14
|Thousands of points|-10| -16
|0| -12 | -18

## Winning Chips Midmatch

Chips are also exchanged during a match:  
* 1 Ron/ 2 Tsumo for Ippatsu, Ura Dora, and drawing the Shiropocci Tile after a Riichi.  
* 2 bonus chips for busting an opponent (split in case of Double Ron)  
* Yakuman (NON KAZOE) grant 10 ron and 5 tsumo
* Drawing all 4 Flower Tiles and winning the hand gives bonus of 10 ron and 5 tsumo (as well as 4 Dora!!)

## Basic Rules

### Every 5 is RED!
Every 5 pin and 5 sou is worth 1 dora.  

### Flower Tiles  
4 Flower tiles are added to the standard 108. When they are drawn, you immediately set them to the side and draw a rinshan tile. Each Flower tile is worth 1 Dora. If a Flower tile is the Dora Indicator, each Flower tile is worth 2 Dora. You win bonus Chips if you set aside all 4 Flowers in a hand.



  
### Shiropocchi
1 Haku tile is replaced with a Shiropocchi, which functions as a Haku normally. However, **if you draw it after you've declared Riichi, you can treat it like any tile you need, even if all the copies of that tile are dead.** You even win bonus chips!
