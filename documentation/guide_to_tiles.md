# Guide To Tiles

This document is a reference for what all the various tiles in [`tiles.md`](tiles.md) are, and how they are commonly used across variants.

## Standard tiles

These tiles are the standard tiles used in Riichi and most variants. The suits, `m`an, `p`in, and `s`ou, are notated with their first letter. `z` stands for "jihai", and indicates winds and dragons.

Note that `5z` is a Riichi-style White Dragon, depicted as a blank tile. `0m`, `0p`, and `0s` are red fives (which, in Riichi, give extra score). `1s` is the Riichi-style design of the 1 of Bamboos, depicted as a peacock.

## Variant tiles and spacers

`0z` is the more-common design of the White Dragon, featured in most Chinese sets. `8z` is the variant most-often used in Malaysian and Singaporean sets.

`9z` is a Kansai-style shiro-pocchi. This is used in some parlour variants of Riichi. It is normally used as a White Dragon, but if a player declares Riichi and then draws the shiro-pocchi on a later turn, they instantly win and the shiro-pocchi is used as a joker.

`00s` is the more-common design of the `1s`, depicted as a sparrow on a branch.

`10m`, `10p`, and `10s` are Ten tiles (as in, the number after 9). Apparently these are sold by some vendors, but we don't know of any mahjong variant that seriously uses them. We've included them here anyway.

`1x` is a tile back. `2x` through to `8x` are transparent spaces used for formatting (useful in displaying the winning hand, for instance).

## Flowers

`1f` through to `4f` are flowers (specifically, the Four Gentlemen quartet), while `1g` through to `4g` are the Seasons quartet.

`1a` through to `4a` are animal tiles common to Singaporean mahjong (in order, Cat, Rat, Chicken, and Centipede). Often, they are used as predator-prey pairs (Cat eats Rat, Chicken eats Centipede), but depending on playgroup, the significance of this can differ.

`1k` through to `4k` are "king" tiles, while `1q` through to `4q` are "queen" tiles. These are treated as flowers in Vietnamese mahjong.

`1y` is a face tile. This is treated as a flower in Malaysian mahjong.

## Jokers

`1j` is an American-style joker. Under NMJL rules, it can substitute for any tile in any Pung, Kong, Quint, or Sextet, but never in a single, pair, or set of singles (such as NEWS, 2025, or 123).

`0j` is a Vietnamese-style joker. It has no restrictions. (TODO: double-check this.) `20j` is another Vietnamese variant of this. `10j` and `2y` are Chinese and Malaysian variants of this.

`2j` is a Vietnamese-style number joker. It substitute for any number tile of any manzu, souzu, or pinzu. `12j` is another variant of this.

`9j`, `4j`, `5j`, `6j`, `7j`, and `8j` are Vietnamese-style jokers. Respectively, they can substitute for any flower, dragon, wind, pinzu, souzu, or manzu tile.

`10j` is a variant of `0j`.

`12j` is a variant of `2j`.

`3j` is a Chinese-style honour joker. It can substitute for any honour tile.

`14j`, `15j`, `17j`, and `18j` are variants of `4j`, `5j`, `7j`, and `8j` respectively.

`19j`, `37j`, `46j`, `147j`, `258j`, and `369j` are number-restricted jokers that can substitute for any of the numbers on their face. `91j`, `64j`, `73j`, and `852j` are variants of `19j`,`46j`, `37j`, and `258j` respectively. (Alternatively, these tiles' codes tell you which tiles they can substitute for.)

`789j`, `456j`, and `123j` are also number-restricted jokers. These can substitute for large, medium, and small numbers respectively (or just see their codes to see which tiles they can substitute for).

`11j` and `22j` can substitute for any odd and any even number respectively.

`20j` is a variant of `0j`.

`30j` can substitute for any five or any honour.

`31j` can substitute for the middle tile of any sequence, or any honour.

`32j` and `33j` respectively can substitute for any tile that isn't/is already in one's hand.

`34j` can substitute for any tile for which all four naturals are publicly visible, or for which no naturals are publicly visible.

`2y` is a variant of `0j`.

## Star tiles

These are tiles of a fourth "star" suit, as seen in four-suit mahjong variants. `10t` is a ten. Note that the above number jokers, `2j` and `12j`, do not apply to these (unless you decide that they should).

## Galaxy tiles

These are used in [Galaxy Mahjong](galaxy.md). Numbered blue tiles may be used as number-restricted jokers of that number. Blue wind and blue dragon tiles are used as wind and dragon jokers respectively. Galaxy Mahjong awards extra points for using jokers as their naturals.

## Aka/Ao/Kin/Transparent

Many of the above natural tiles, now as red, dark-blue, and gold variants (for extra parlour riichi rules). Transparent tiles, starting with `4`, are also included, to allow for setting tiles as any colour you like.
