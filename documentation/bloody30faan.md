## Bloody 30 Faan Jokers (B30FJ)

The wall for Bloody 30 Faan Jokers is composed of the following:

- four each of the 1-9 character tiles
- four each of the 1-9 circle tiles
- four each of the 1-9 bamboo tiles
- four each of the four winds
- four each of the three dragons
- no flowers
- one of each of these eight jokers of varying power:
  + Baida joker (白搭): Can represent any tile above.
  + Suit joker (筒索萬): Can represent any suited tile.
  + Honors joker (番): Can represent any honor tile.
  + Wind joker (🀀🀁🀂🀃): Can represent any wind.
  + Dragon joker (🀄︎🀅🀆): Can represent any dragon.
  + Character joker (萬): Can represent any character tile.
  + Circle joker (筒): Can represent any circle tile.
  + Bamboo joker (索): Can represent any bamboo tile.

There are four winning hand configurations in B30FJ:

- Four sets and a pair. Sets are triplets or sequences.
- Seven Pairs (no repeats).
- Thirteen Orphans (each terminal and honor tile, one of them forming a pair).
- Thirteen Unconnected. To achieve this, you must have 13 disconnected tiles with one forming a pair. In addition, the suited tiles among them must form a partial Knitted Triplets or a partial Knitted Straight; and you must have at least one tile of each suit, at least one wind, and at least one dragon.

For more information about Thirteen Unconnected, refer to the relevant section below (Unconnected Hands).

Bloody end rules are enabled, meaning after the first win, remaining players continue playing until three players have won, or until the wall is exhausted. Multiple players may win off the same discard. Wins do not skip turns.

In addition, if the wait tile is a single-tile wait for a pair on the Baida or Suit joker, one can only win by self-draw.

There is no dead wall.

## Calls

In addition to the normal calls (Sheung, Pung, Kong) you may declare a joker like a flower tile, awarding one additional faan each.

The call precedence is Kong > Pung > Sheung. In the event of multiple kong or multiple pung, the kong/pung with no jokers takes precedence, then the kong/pung using a weaker joker takes precedence.

There are also the following restrictions regarding jokers and calls:

- You cannot sheung a discarded joker.
- You cannot pung or kong a discard using more than one joker.
- You cannot add a joker to a pung.
- You cannot concealed kong with a joker.

Concealed kongs are completely hidden until the end of a round.

Swap-calling is disallowed.

Adding a tile to a pung to make a kong is eligible for Robbing a Kong, but flower declarations are not.
