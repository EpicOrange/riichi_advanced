This is our current badly-translated understanding of the rules presented in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDaKM7eU7zE). If you spot any errors, please let us know.

This ruleset assumes that you have read [riichi.md](documentation/riichi.md).

Galaxy Mahjong is played with a standard Riichi set. However, one copy of each tile is blue, and is known as a "galaxy joker". (The blue copy of the 5z is a 0z.)

Blue numbered tiles are rank-restricted jokers of that number; e.g. the blue 1m may be used as a 1m, 1p, or 1s only. Likewise, blue wind tiles may be used as any wind. Blue dragons may be used as any dragon.

If the dora indicator is a blue numbered tile, all numbers of the following rank are dora (e.g. a blue 7p being dora indicator means that all 8m, 8p, and 8s are dora). Similarly, if the dora indicator is a blue wind or dragon, all winds or dragons respectively are dora.

Having a hand comprising 14 galaxy jokers is a yakuman, called "Milky Way". This is valid even if the hand is open, even if it's won off a discarded galaxy joker, and even if the hand doesn't conform to the standard winning hand shapes.

If multiple players want to pon/kan the same tile, the next player in turn order has priority.

Concealed kans are displayed with all tiles face-up.

All other rules are identical to Riichi.

## NOT YET IMPLEMENTED IN RIICHI ADVANCED:

When playing with shuugi, each galaxy tile used in a natural meld/pair yields 1 shuugi upon win. (A natural meld/pair is one where all galaxy tiles are used as their non-blue equivalents.) e.g. a 7m blue-8m blue-9m receives 2 shuugi.
